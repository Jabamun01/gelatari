# Backend Step 3: Set Up Project Directory Structure

## Task Description
Create the standard directory structure for the Express.js backend application within the `src` directory. This structure helps organize the codebase by separating concerns.

**Note:** This step involves creating directories, likely using CLI commands like `mkdir`.

## Files to Read
*   None (This step creates new directories).

## Constraints Reminder
*   Use only arrow functions (=>) for any future JavaScript/TypeScript code. No `function`, `class`, or `this`.
*   Write all code exclusively within the provided tool (when applicable in later steps).
*   Adhere to the "No Shared Code" policy between frontend and backend.

## Deliverables
*   Creation of the following directories:
    *   `src/`
    *   `src/config/`
    *   `src/routes/`
    *   `src/controllers/`
    *   `src/services/`
    *   `src/models/`
    *   `src/utils/`

## Manual Testing Note
After implementing, verify that all the specified directories exist within the `/home/patata/Documents/receptari` project root.
