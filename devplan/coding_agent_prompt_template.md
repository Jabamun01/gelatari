# AI Coding Agent Task: Ice Cream Recipe Workshop App Development

## General Application Context

You are tasked with developing parts of the Ice Cream Recipe Workshop App. This is a simple web application designed for use in a workshop environment (primarily on tablets) for storing, viewing, and using ice cream recipes. Its key features include live search, recipe categorization (ice cream/sorbet vs. non-ice cream), ingredient management with allergen highlighting, recipe scaling, default step insertion, a tabbed interface for managing multiple open recipes, and a production mode with ingredient tracking and a timer. The technical stack involves PNPM, TypeScript, React (Frontend), Express.js (Backend), MongoDB, Linaria, and @tanstack/react-query.

## General Reminders & Constraints (Apply to ALL Steps)

*   **Arrow Functions Only:** You MUST use only arrow functions (`=>`) for all JavaScript/TypeScript function definitions. Do NOT use the `function` keyword, `class` keyword, or the `this` keyword.
*   **Tool Usage Only:** Generate ALL code and perform ALL file modifications exclusively using the provided coding tool. Do not output code directly in your response text.
*   **No Shared Code:** Strictly adhere to the "No Shared Code" policy. Frontend and backend codebases are independent. Define types (interfaces) separately in each project as needed, even if they represent the same conceptual data.
*   **Manual Testing:** After implementing the changes described in the step, manually test the specified functionality to ensure it works correctly, as outlined in the step's "Manual Testing Note".
