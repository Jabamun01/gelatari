Frontend Step 28: Implement Recipe Editor Linked Recipes Section (Obsolete)

NOTE: This step has been merged into Step 26 (Implement Recipe Editor Components Section).

The functionality for adding, removing, and displaying linked recipes is now handled within the unified "Components" section described in the updated `devplan/frontend_step_26_recipe_editor_ingredient_section.md`.
